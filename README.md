# AI-Powered Personalized Learning Gap Analyzer 🎓

**Aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 – Quality Education**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Personalized Learning Gap Analyzer** is a web-based application designed to help learners identify their learning gaps in any subject and receive **personalized learning recommendations**.

The system combines:

- **Rule-based logic** (confidence-based assessment)
- **Artificial Intelligence concepts** for intelligent feedback

This project demonstrates the application of **Applied AI in Education**, supporting self-assessment, adaptive learning, and improved academic outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Enable learners to self-assess their understanding of a topic
- Identify learning gaps based on confidence levels
- Provide personalized learning recommendations
- Support inclusive and quality education aligned with **UN SDG 4**

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional learning systems face several challenges:

- One-size-fits-all teaching approach
- Lack of personalization
- No mechanism to identify individual learning gaps
- Limited feedback and guidance

As a result, learners often struggle to decide what to study next and how to improve.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The project introduces an **AI-powered personalized learning system** that:

- Allows learners to self-assess confidence levels
- Classifies learning understanding using rule-based logic
- Generates tailored learning guidance
- Encourages adaptive and self-paced learning

## ⚙️ Rule-Based Logic

The system uses confidence scores to classify learning levels:

| Confidence Score | Learning Level |
|------------------|----------------|
| 0 – 3            | Low            |
| 4 – 7            | Medium         |
| 8 – 10           | High           |

This ensures reliable output even without advanced AI services.
